/**
 * Event used internally by the plugin to detect if a hypothetical BlockBreak
 * would be cancelled by another plugin.
 *
 * Used in determining whether drops should occur when heads might be broken by
 * a player. This is useful when using plugins such as WorldGuard that cancel
 * blockbreak in protected areas.
 *
 * This version of the class currently extends FakeBlockBreakEvent so that
 * external plugin compatibility is not broken, but this is intended to be the
 * new location of the class in the future.
