# PlayerHeads
Bukkit Plugin - Drops a player's head when s/he dies, also mob heads
* Drop player heads on player death
* Drop mob heads on death
* Configure drop rate chances
* Configure whether player-kills are required to drop

All credit goes to meiskam for creating the plugin and zand, Dragoboss, any many others for maintaining it.

# Glowstone support
This is the implementation branch for Glowstone 1.12 server support.  Glowstone is a bukkit-compatible which is not quite yet feature-complete, and as such, certain features of the plugin may not yet operate properly.

Currently, heads are dropped for mobs as normal, but all custom heads are untextured.  Texturing support here is dependent on [some source changes](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone/issues/977) in Glowstone that are currently pending or expected and are not released as of yet.
